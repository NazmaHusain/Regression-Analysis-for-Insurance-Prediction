# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children and region. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, visualization, and model training to build the predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project (`Medical_insurance.csv`) contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender 
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children
- `smoker`: Smoking status 
- `region`: Region of residence
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- joblib

## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values.
- Converted categorical data (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) into numerical values.
- Generated visualizations to understand feature relationships.
- Computed correlation heatmap to identify redundant features.
- 
## Machine Learning Models
Two regression models were trained to predict medical insurance costs:
1. **RandomForestRegressor**
2. **XGBRegressor** (Selected as the best model based on performance)

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Applied **RandomForestRegressor** and **XGBRegressor** models.
- Evaluated models using **RÂ² score**.
- **Cross-validation (10-fold)** was used to select the best model.
- **XGBRegressor** was identified as the best-performing model.
- The final trained model (`XGBRegressor`) was saved using **Joblib**.
- The model can be loaded and used for new predictions.

## Usage
To use the trained model for prediction, do
```python
import joblib
loaded_model = joblib.load("final_model_XGB.joblib")
new_data = [[23, 1, 32.007, 10, 1, 3]]  # Example input
predicted_charges = loaded_model.predict(new_data)
print(predicted_charges)
```

## Insights
- Medical insurance costs **increase with age and BMI**.
- **Smokers have significantly higher charges** than non-smokers.
- **XGBRegressor outperforms RandomForestRegressor** in prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project successfully applies machine learning to predict medical insurance costs. The use of feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation techniques ensures accurate predictions and valuable insights into healthcare costs.
